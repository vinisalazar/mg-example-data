Original data used to create this repository come from the [CAMI data portal](https://data.cami-challenge.org/participate) and are deposited at as a [GigaDB dataset](http://gigadb.org/dataset/100344) (see DOI badge above). More specifically, they are the CAMI I Challenge Low complexity dataset, but only the first 2 million lines (500k reads) of the single sample the dataset contains. These 2M lines are then broken into 8 different files to test for the different possible input types.
