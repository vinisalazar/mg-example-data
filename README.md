These data come from the [CAMI data portal](https://data.cami-challenge.org/participate). More specifically, they are the CAMI I Challenge Low complexity dataset, but only the first 2 million lines (500k reads) of the single sample the dataset contains. These 2M lines are then broken into 8 different files to test for the different possible input types.
